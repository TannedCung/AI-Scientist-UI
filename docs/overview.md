# Project Overview

## AI Scientist Paper Generator

The AI Scientist Paper Generator is an innovative platform that automates the process of generating workshop-level scientific papers through AI-driven research and experimentation. This platform leverages the capabilities of large language models and agentic tree search to autonomously conduct scientific research from idea to publication-ready paper.

## Vision and Purpose

The primary goal of the AI Scientist Paper Generator is to accelerate scientific discovery by automating the experimental process. By combining user input with artificial intelligence, the platform can:

1. Generate novel research hypotheses based on initial ideas
2. Design and run autonomous experiments
3. Analyze experimental results
4. Generate comprehensive scientific papers
5. Visualize findings in a clear, readable format

This platform serves researchers, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners who want to explore new ideas efficiently, without the manual overhead typically associated with scientific experimentation.

## Key Components

### Research Idea Creation

Users begin by providing a research idea through a streamlined interface. This includes:
- A descriptive title
- Relevant keywords
- A TL;DR summary
- A comprehensive abstract
- Python code that defines the experimental environment

### Hypothesis Generation

The AI Scientist engine analyzes the provided research idea and generates several potential research hypotheses. These hypotheses are formulated to be:
- Testable through experimentation
- Relevant to the research domain
- Novel and interesting
- Grounded in scientific principles

### Experiment Execution

The platform runs autonomous experiments using the provided Python code and the AI-Scientist-v2 engine. This process involves:
- Setting up the experimental environment
- Executing experiments based on hypotheses
- Collecting and organizing results
- Handling errors and edge cases adaptively

### Scientific Paper Generation

Based on experimental results, the system generates workshop-level scientific papers that include:
- Introduction and background
- Methodology description
- Results analysis
- Visualizations and tables
- Discussion and conclusion
- References where applicable

## Target Users

The AI Scientist Paper Generator is designed for:

- **Academic Researchers**: Who want to quickly test new ideas or hypotheses
- **Data Scientists**: Looking to automate experimental workflows
- **ML Engineers**: Exploring model improvements or innovative approaches
- **Students**: Learning about research methodology through automated experimentation
- **Industry R&D Teams**: Accelerating the research pipeline

## Integration with AI-Scientist-v2

This platform integrates with the [AI-Scientist-v2](https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist-v2) framework, which provides the core AI capabilities for:

- Agentic tree search for experiment planning
- Large language model integration for hypothesis generation and paper writing
- Experiment execution and monitoring
- Result analysis and visualization

## Future Roadmap
